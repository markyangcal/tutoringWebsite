    <p class="about"> I am experienced with teaching students how to learn. My tutoring sessions are not just answer sessions. I strive to help students identify their own weaknesses and build up good study habits. Tutoring sessions should only require an hour or two each week.

I treat the SAT differently than the regular classes. I am a firm believer that the SAT can be studied for. I can teach the student strategies for both preparation and test taking. I did not learn English until I was 12, but I scored a 780 on the reading section.

I graduated from MIT with a Bachelor’s and Master's degree in electrical engineering.

Lastly, I am a firm believer of quality over quantity. My hope is that for the SAT prepping, the student will not need my help for more than a few sessions. The sooner the student no longer needs me, the better. Do not pay me if the student is not satisfied with my first lesson. I want to spread good study habits and help those who want to be helped - I am not looking for many students, I just want to make a big impact on whom I do help. </p>
